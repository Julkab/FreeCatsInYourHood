<sup> The very first app of mine in process... </sup>

 I wanted to write something on my own, and I came up with the idea that my code would search for cats that can be adopted in the given area in poland. 

For this purpose I decided to use Selenium WebDriver 4.9 for Python to scraping OLX.pl.

<sup> The project will be developed with new functionalities. </sup>

Firstly a window with a query appears.

Then input is required. (polish cities are recommended to insert because the polish site is used for searching)

The cat in your area is searching! 
With using sorting by latest offers

Then it's searching for (and clicking) newest announcement skipping paid ones.
